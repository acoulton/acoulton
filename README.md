## Hi there, I'm Andrew 👋

I've been a full-time software developer for almost 13 years, with 15 years before that building side projects that made life and work easier for me and my colleagues. I've also been contributing to open source for nearly 20 years.

These days I work mostly in PHP and Javascript. Over the years, I've worked in a wide range of languages - BASIC, VBA, Turbo Pascal, C, Java, Ruby, Go, and probably more that I've forgotten about 😆

I'm a maintainer for [Behat](https://github.com/Behat/Behat), the PHP Behaviour Driven Development tool. Along with the other maintainers, I review PRs and issues, support users, and contribute fixes and features.

For my day job, I founded, own & run [inGenerator](https://github.com/ingenerator), a small company based in Scotland that builds technology for arts and cultural organisations. We open source and share as much of our work as we can - mostly PHP libraries which you'll find on my company's Github page.

### My sponsors

If you'd like to support and encourage my open source work, you can [❤️ sponsor me through Github](https://github.com/sponsors/acoulton).

I'm very grateful for recurring support from:
